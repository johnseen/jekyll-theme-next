   root@deku# hostname --fqdn
   worker2.clu.kube.com

#### Zonefile

A zonefile is simply a text file made of a variety of different records for an indivdual domain.Each line of a zonefile contains the name of a particular domain, and then value and type associated with it. For instance,in `google.com`'s zonefile, there may exists a line which denotes `www` translates, via an `A record` to `173.194.34.68`

#### Records

A DNS record is a single mapping between a domain and relevant data -for instance, an IP address in the case of an `A record`,or a mail server's domain name,in the case of an `Mx record`. Many records make up a zonefile.
